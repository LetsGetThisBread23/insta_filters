# insta_filters
Some code to apply visual transformations to photos -> b&amp;w, sepia, blur, reflect

I designed this code to experiment with bitmap image files (.BMP). 

Run:

./filter -g INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp

To perform the grayscale filter on the file INFILE.bmp and to create OUTFILE.bmp with the filter applied. Use -r, -s, -b for the reflect, sepia, blur filters respectively
